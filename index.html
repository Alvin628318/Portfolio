        <p>A composer from Taiwan. I write music that blends classical and romantic style/form with  
          contemporary color. My most recent piece is my Symphony No.1 in A Major, first movement (Vivace). 
          I'm also a pianist and percussionist. Contact me at <a href="mailto:alvinlinpersonal@gmail.com">alvinlinpersonal@gmail.com</a> </p>

        <h2 id="contact-title">FAQ</h2>
        <p>Q: What inspired you to start composing? <br>
          A: In elementary school, we had a project where we had to come up with a graduation song. I came up with a melody that the class voted as the best. 
          That was when I figured that I actually could write music myself. <br><br>
          Q: When did you start composing? <br>
          A: I started playing around with my piano and MuseScore(Notation software) when I was around 13~14. At the time, I made mostly unfinished pop-style songs. I started seriously composing when I was 16.
          Since then, I made several pieces in both classical and pop style. <br><br>
          Q: How old are you now? <br>
          A: 17 - last year of high school. <br><br>
          Q: Which 3 composers do you like the most? <br>
          A: (In alphabetical sequence) Beethoven, Dvorak, Mozart. <br><br>
          Q: Which contemporary composer do you admire the most? <br>
          A: Toby Fox. <br><br>
          Q: Which pop song do you like the most? <br>
          A: Coldplay: Viva la Vida <br><br>
          Q: Which piano piece do you enjoy the most? <br>
          A: Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor "Pathetique", Op. 13<br><br>
          Q: Which symphony movement do you enjoy the most? <br>
          A: Dvorak: Symphony No. 8 in G Major, Op. 88: II. Adagio <br><br>
          Q: Who do you think, out of all due respect, is the most overrated composer? <br>
          A: Chopin. (Personal opinion, don't get mad) <br><br>
          Q: Out of all music ever conceived, which one piece is your favorite? <br>
          A: Mozart: Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622 <br><br>
          Q: Is the four pieces displayed here the only works you've composed? <br>
          A: No. I've composed a few more complete pieces. I also have quite a lot of unfinished works, ranging from partly finished to merely just a melodic idea/theme. 
          In the end, I chose four of my best completed works up for show. <br><br>
          Q: Which one of your pieces are you the most proud of? <br>
          A: My latest piece: Symphony No.1 in A Major - I. Vivace. <br><br>
          Q: How good do you think you are, in terms of compositional skill? <br>
          A: Somewhat good, but absolutely terrible compared to musical giants like Beethoven. <br><br>
          Q: Why did you use MS Basic as the sound library for <i>The Summer Dream</i> instead of the objectively better sounding MuseSounds? <br>
          A: When I started the piece, I didn't know that MuseSounds existed (Or it just didn't at the time). So when I heard about MuseSounds, 
          I still finished the piece in MS Basic because the dynamics, articulations, and general sounds are entirely different from MuseSounds. If I were to switch to MuseSounds instead, I would've needed to
          change the instrumentation and re-orchestrate the entire piece in order to make it sound the same as before. I didn't want that, and so I proceeded with MS Basic. <br><br>
          Q: How do you feel about AI in music? <br>
          A: While AI is beneficial in many other ways (Including assisting me, a novice coder, in building this very website), I firmly believe that <b>artifical intelligence has absolutely no place in any human arts, including music.</b> 
          I did not, and will not ever use any AI in any of my music, directly or indirectly, under any circumstances. <br><br>
          Q: Are you open to any commissions? <br>
          A: If you don't mind my currently immature music composition skills, then feel free to contact me through my email listed above, and I'll try my very best. <br><br></p>

        detailLine: '<b>Summary</b>: \n\nThe first movement of Symphony No. 1 in A Major unfolds as a vivid emotional journey within classical sonata form. It begins with a lively, radiant first theme before giving way to a lyrical clarinet solo whose calm expressiveness anchors the movement’s heart. What follows is a dramatic transformation: joy turns to despair, the clarinet’s warmth replaced by the oboe’s deceptive imitation, plunging the music into darkness. A battle between light and shadow ensues, culminating in the flute’s victorious return and the orchestra’s euphoric resurgence. The recapitulation brings genuine peace — the clarinet’s melody returns, tender and real, leading to a triumphant conclusion of six brilliant A-major chords. Through contrast, illusion, and resolution, this movement captures the struggle and ultimate renewal of the human spirit. \n\n<b>Full Program Notes:</b> \n\nI composed the first movement of my Symphony No. 1 between July and September 2025. It follows the classical sonata form, yet the music itself feels like a story of emotion, conflict, and return — a journey from radiant joy through darkness and doubt, toward a hard-won sense of peace. Though conceived as the opening movement of a larger work, it already encapsulates a full narrative arc on its own. \n\n
The movement opens in A major with a lively and graceful first theme, built around its distinctive A–E–A motif. The orchestration here is deliberately light, allowing the two halves of the orchestra to “speak” to one another in phrases of question and response. This exchange gives the music a conversational energy, while the clear harmonic grounding in A major provides a sense of warmth and poise. It is a joyous beginning — confident but unforced, smooth to the ear, and bright in spirit. \n\n
After this first theme resolves to a firm cadence, the music pauses before introducing the second theme group in the dominant key of E major. The contrast is immediate and striking: the clarinet steps forward, marked cantabile, to sing an elegant, expressive melody. Although set in a major key, the theme’s emotion is not simply cheerful; beneath its serenity lies a tender introspection. The clarinet is soon joined by gentle accompaniment from other instruments, but remains the clear protagonist — a single voice singing with calm, heartfelt beauty. I have always found this melody to be the emotional core of the entire symphony, the moment where listeners may feel most at home. \n\n
The second theme unfolds in three subthemes that grow naturally from one another. The first subtheme is intimate and lyrical; the second gradually thickens the orchestration as more instruments join; and the third blossoms into a majestic full-orchestra statement — powerful yet still expressive, grand yet rooted in the same emotional world as the clarinet’s song. After this climactic passage, the music retreats to a return of the first subtheme, now richer in texture, with clarinet, horn, and violins sharing the melody. This reprise transforms the solitude of the original clarinet line into a moment of companionship — the same melody, but no longer alone. \n\n
I was inspired by Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto when writing this passage, though the result ultimately became something distinct from Mozart’s own voice. His lyricism inspired me to create a melody of my own that could move listeners in a similar way — not through imitation, but through sincerity and simplicity. \n\n
The development section begins by recalling the first theme in the dominant key, now with thicker orchestration and a sense of exuberance. Then, unexpectedly, the texture thins to a new quiet theme for flute and strings. Listeners might expect this idea to build toward a grand climax, but I chose to do the opposite: the theme gradually fades away, with instruments leaving one by one until only flute and violin remain, lightly sustained by cello. The harmony shifts into E minor — the movement’s first venture into a minor key — and suddenly the mood darkens. The brightness that defined the exposition gives way to desolation. What was once joyful and hopeful now turns into something painful and searching. \n\n
A transformed version of the first theme then appears in the minor mode, its melody altered and filled with tension. It grows louder with each repetition until the strings erupt into a new, turbulent theme driven by intricate counterpoint. The sound is restless and dense, the harmony unsettled, until the energy dissipates and only a single violin remains, whispering soft fragments that lead gently into F major. From this near silence emerges an altered version of the second theme’s first subtheme — familiar, yet eerily changed. \n\n
This moment marks what I consider the most clever and meaningful design in the entire movement. After all the despair, a glimpse of calm reappears: the same lyrical theme returns, now in F major, lightly scored. It feels at first like homecoming — the listener might believe the storm is over — but something is subtly wrong. The melody, though recognizable, is altered. Most importantly, it is played not by the clarinet, but by the oboe. The oboe’s sharper timbre gives the passage an edge of unease. The music seems to smile, but the smile feels strained. Then comes the moment of revelation: an A-flat appears where one expects A-natural, and with that single note, the illusion collapses. The key plunges to F minor, and the false tranquility is consumed by darkness — the movement’s most terrifying passage. The oboe, now the villainous counterpart to the clarinet, leads the orchestra into a vision of menace and despair. \n\n
Twice this false reprise appears, and twice it deceives. The second time, the oboe’s melody turns warm again, joined by horn and strings in beautiful harmony — but once more, it abruptly descends into minor darkness. Out of this turmoil, the flute returns, pure and radiant, leading a sequence of modulations — from G to C minor, C to D major, A major, and finally E major. Each modulation feels like a battle between light and shadow. At last, the flute triumphs: its melody ascends without any trace of minor harmony, a victory over darkness. The orchestra falls silent as the flute plays two measures alone, as bright and strong as a human breath after struggle. Then, in two measures, the entire orchestra reenters, one section after another, surging into the most triumphant climax of the entire movement. The return to the iconic A–E–A motif marks the restoration of light — the recapitulation begins. \n\n
The recapitulation mirrors the exposition but in transformed spirit. The first theme, now in A major, bursts forth in full euphoria. The horns lead with majestic resonance; the orchestration is thicker, the harmonies more radiant. Even when the volume drops briefly, the joy remains undiminished. After so much turbulence, this return feels cathartic — an unrestrained celebration. The first theme is more concise here, driving directly into the second theme, which now appears in the home key of A major. \n\n
At this point, the music finally rests. The clarinet, joined by flute and horn, sings the second theme’s opening melody once more — the genuine one this time, not the deceptive imitation. No oboe intrudes; no darkness lingers. The melody that once embodied comfort now carries the weight of everything that came before. Its beauty lies not just in its sound but in its context — a healing moment after suffering, a glimpse of peace. I chose to have this theme sung only once here, so its brevity would make it feel fleeting, like fireworks that linger in memory after they fade. \n\n
The final pages of the movement bring back the grandeur of the third subtheme, now in its fullest majesty. The coda introduces a new theme, first in the strings, then expanded to include woodwinds, brass, and timpani. With each repetition, the energy grows until the entire orchestra unites for the closing measures. The movement ends with six resounding A-major chords — bright, powerful, and unambiguous. After such a long journey through light and darkness, the ending feels not merely triumphant but cleansing. \n\n
This movement represents my own interpretation of a classical “exposition–climax–resolution” narrative. In some ways, it parallels the structural philosophy of Beethoven’s Fifth, where tension ultimately resolves in triumph — yet my symphony follows its own path, drawing on clarity, lyricism, and emotional storytelling. It is music of contrast: between joy and sorrow, truth and illusion, despair and deliverance. For me, the Vivace is not only a study in sonata form, but a portrait of resilience — of how even after the deepest darkness, the sound of home can return brighter than before.

        detailLine: '<b>Summary</b>: \n\nString Quintet No. 1 in F Major tells an inner story through a continuous three-part design for violin, viola, two cellos, and double bass. Beginning in quiet melancholy, the music traces a passage from reflection to fleeting hope, then drifts into a semi-dream of nostalgia. The final section, in lilting 6/8 and radiant G major, unfolds through four interwoven melodies that grow in texture and emotion until all instruments unite in a single expressive line. The piece closes on a gentle IV–I cadence, fading into silence — a musical depiction of half-wakefulness, where longing, memory, and peace coexist. \n\n<b>Full Program Notes</b>: \n\nWritten for violin, viola, two cellos, and double bass, my String Quintet No. 1 in F Major unfolds as a single continuous narrative rather than a conventional form. Across three distinct yet connected sections, the music traces an inner emotional journey — from quiet despair, through fleeting hope, to a half-dream of memory and reconciliation. Though the work uses classical harmony and counterpoint, it speaks through a contemporary lens of storytelling and emotional realism. \n\n
The opening section, in 4/4 and F major, begins in quiet sorrow. A violin and cello trade phrases as if conversing in broken sentences while the double bass provides a slow, grounding pulse. Despite the major key, the tone is far from cheerful: it reflects exhaustion, regret, and the subdued ache that comes at the end of a long day. The alternating voices — one resting as the other speaks — create the sense of sighing, of asking silent questions to which no answer comes. When the melody finally reaches the submediant (VI) before settling on the dominant, the harmony feels like a deep breath that never fully releases. It is the sound of someone lying awake, overwhelmed by the weight of life yet unable to rest. \n\n
The second section begins almost imperceptibly from that silence. The music gathers courage, as though the same weary mind is now urging itself toward hope. Encouraging harmonies and brighter intervals lift the mood; the rhythm gains motion, aspiring toward strength. This hopeful surge culminates in a brief ascent to A — the highest point of the line — before cascading downward step by step (A–G–F–E–D). The descent suggests the inevitable collapse of self-encouragement, the moment when optimism proves fleeting. The harmony modulates through D minor into D major, concluding with a quiet IV–I cadence. Here the energy dissipates, and the listener senses consciousness slipping. The person drifts into a half-asleep, half-awake state — a threshold between reality and reverie. \n\n
In that liminal space begins the third and longest section, marked by a shift to 6/8 and the luminous key of G major. This “semi-dream” forms the emotional heart of the quintet. The music recalls scenes of childhood — simplicity, warmth, and innocence — but its joy is tinted by nostalgia. The section develops from a single, graceful theme built on four intertwining melodic lines, each with its own rhythm and character. \n\n
Melody 1 (violin) is light, playful, and lyrical. \n\n
Melody 2 (first cello, later joined by viola) sings more expressively, carrying a tender emotional weight. \n\n
Melody 3 and Melody 4 provide rhythmic and harmonic contrast, weaving counterpoint that grows in complexity with each repetition. \n\n
At first, the ensemble plays softly: violin and cello lead while the bass supports with a gentle waltz-like motion. With each iteration, new voices join, the texture thickens, and the dynamics swell. What begins as delicate reminiscence gradually transforms into passionate remembrance. As the repetitions continue, Melody 2 gains prominence, shifting the focus from innocent playfulness to longing — the realization that such happiness belongs to the past. \n\n
Eventually the viola takes command, introducing Melody 4 with greater intensity. The second cello adopts Melody 3, the double bass resumes a waltz accompaniment, and the entire ensemble builds toward an emotional climax. Near its peak, a brief D-sharp-diminished harmony (D♯–F♯–A) pierces the texture — a fleeting cry of despair, the recognition that one cannot return to childhood. In its aftermath, the rhythmic independence of the four lines dissolves: all instruments, except the resting double bass, play Melody 4 in unison. The counterpoint that once symbolized many independent thoughts merges into a single, unified voice — pure, direct, and deeply human. This moment of unity, simple after such intricacy, conveys catharsis more powerful than any harmonic resolution. \n\n
The closing measures quiet gradually, as if the mind is finally surrendering to sleep. The music settles on an unconventional IV–I cadence in G major, avoiding a firm period at the end. The sound fades into silence without a full stop, mirroring the indistinct moment when thought dissolves into dream. The quintet ends not with triumph or despair, but with gentle ambiguity — a mix of peace, sadness, and acceptance. For me, it captures the delicate line between consciousness and rest, where emotion blurs and the heart speaks most truthfully.
